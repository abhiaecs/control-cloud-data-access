# control-cloud-data-access
Cloud computing is a revolutionary computing paradigm, which enables flexible, on-demand,  and low-cost usage of computing resources, but the data is outsourced to some cloud servers,  and various privacy concerns emerge from it. Various schemes based on the attribute-based  encryption have been proposed to secure the cloud storage. However, most work focuses on  the data contents privacy and the access control, while less attention is paid to the privilege  control and the identity privacy. In this paper, we present a semi anonymous privilege control  scheme AnonyControl to address not only the data privacy, but also the user identity privacy  in existing access control schemes. AnonyControl decentralizes the central authority to limit  the identity leakage and thus achieves semianonymity. Besides, it also generalizes the file  access control to the privilege control, by which privileges of all operations on the cloud data  can be managed in a fine-grained manner. Subsequently, we present the AnonyControl-F,  which fully prevents the identity leakage and achieve the full anonymity. Our security analysis  shows that both AnonyControl and AnonyControl-F are secure under the decisional bilinear  Diffieâ€“Hellman assumption, and our performance evaluation exhibits the feasibility of our  schemes.
